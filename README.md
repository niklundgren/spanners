# Spanners

    Helpful tools I've created or found to be helpful in my computational chemistry PhD.


## Bin Scripts

    These are things that I keep on hand, mostly helpful bash stuff. Bashmarks is a real gem.

## Bookmarks

    Literally, web bookmarks I like to keep organized.

## Configurations

    Config files for programs I use often for settings I find annoying to deal with on a regular basis

## Installers

    Notes and examples for installing many materials science packages and computational science resources.

## Matsci

### Examples

    Lammps - 
        Donadio: A very well commented lammps script with some basic lammps-ian workflows (as in
            you use lammps like a script-interpreter to set variables, then use those variables
            to affect MD behavrior)

        Sievers: A bare-bones script for getting IFC's from lammps

### Formatting

    Pre-made ASE scripts to change formates of molecular geometries quickly

### Miscellaneous

    Just things I wrote I found handy and resuable in some capacity

## Package Notes

    Things like, what are matplotlib's adjustable RC params? That are kept as text files so you
    can grep them easily for specifics. It's like a grab bag of documentation I found important
    to keep on hand so I don't need to memorize it.
