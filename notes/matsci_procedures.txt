# Running an DFPT phonons from quantum espresso
1. Optimize DFT parameters by converging each against energy
Start with some geometry that's about right, you could optionally run a vc-relax with some 
guesses about the parameters.
Then optimize E against these parameters one at a time. This is my reccomended order
kpts - Use the vc-relax, and make sure ecutwfc is set about the recommended value in your chosen
    pseudopotential. If it's a 2d material, use a vacuum of about 10 A and make sure it's only 
    optimizing cell parameters in x+y with the "celldofree = '2Dxy'" argument (in cell "card")
ecutwfc - Make sure this is at or above the ecutwfc recommended in the pseudopotential
(optional) kpts - if you suspect things have changed a lot since the initial kpt-optimization
    you could double check this, but it's probably okay to continue
(optional) ecutrho - This is not as important but a good thing to do. Should be about 3-4x ecutwfc

2. Now that you're confident about parameters, run the equation of state. Several ways to do this,
but the easiest method is customize the template in this repo. Based of work from Davide
Basically, run an scf calculation with small changes in the lattice parameter (~0.05 to 0.1 angstrom)
and then fit the energy vs volume curve with one of the "Equation of State" formulations (e.g. 
Murnaghan or Vinet)
The template I made uses murnaghan, but vinet is fine too. 
You could even just fit with a cubic function in numpy and plot it up, that's fine too.
